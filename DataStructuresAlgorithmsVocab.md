# Data structures can be classified into two main groups, primitive and non-primative. 
* primative data structures are those supported by programming languages such as integers, floating point numbes, and boolean values.
*  The terms data type, basic data type, and primative data type are often interchangable.
*  Non primative data structures are those that are created from primatives, things such as linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs.

# Linear and Non linear Data Structures
* Some examples of linear data structures are arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues 
* Linear data strucures can be represented through sequential memory locations or through linear relationships where elements are sequentially linked to each other.
* Non-Linear data structures include things such as binary trees or graphs.

# Data Structure Types

## Arrays
* A collection of similar elements that have the same data type the elements of an array are stored consecutively in memory.
* Fixed size

## Linked Lists
* Unlike arays linked lists are flexible data structures.
* As nodes are added to the list they are allocated memory.
* Each node has a pointer to the next node.
* The last node of the list has a null pointer indicating it is the last node. 

## Stacks
* A stack is known as a first in last out data structure in which changes to the stack are made at a single position. They can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

## Queues
* A queue unlike a stack is known as a first in first out data structure.
* Elements are added in the rear and are taken out at the front
* They can be implemented using linked lists or arrays

## Trees
* A tree is a collection of nodes arranged in hierarchial order.
* There is one root node and the ramaning nodes can be grouped into set with each set being its own sub tree.
* Nodes are placed on levels

## Graphs
* Graphs are also collections of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes. 
* Two nodes that are connectd by and edge are called neighbors

# Operations on Data Structures

## Traversing
* Accessing each element of data once

## Searching
* Searching for a particular value in a dataset

## Inserting
* Adding a value to the data structure

## Deleting
* Removing an element or item from the data structure

## Sorting
* Organizing the values of a data structure in a particular order based on a given constraint.

## Merging
* Combining two sets of data into a singular one.
